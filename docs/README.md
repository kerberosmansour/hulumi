# Hulumi documentation

Welcome. This index is the single jumping-off point for every doc in the repo. Pick your starting point by what you're trying to do.

## Reference

- [Components](./components/README.md) — `SecureBucket`, `AccountFoundation`, `AwsOrganizationSecurityFoundation`, `PulumiStateBackendFoundation`, `EksClusterFoundation`, `SecurityDetectionFoundation`, `RunnerGovernanceFoundation`, `DriftClassifier`, `hulumi validate live`, plus the K8s/EKS surface (`HardenedHelmRelease`, `EksSubnetTagger`, `IstioFoundation`, `AlbMeshedHttpEntrypoint`, `KubernetesSecretFromAwsSecretsManager`, `RdsCredentialSecret`, `GitHubAppCredential`).
- [Framework mappings](./mappings/) — CCM v4.1, CIS AWS v5.0.0, NIST 800-53 r5, NIST 800-218A, MITRE ATLAS v5.1.
- [Tier matrix](./tiers.md) — what differs between Sandbox and Startup-Hardened, by component.
- [Threat-model examples](./threat-model-examples/) — sample outputs from `/hulumi-threat-model`.
- [Release notes](./release/) — package-release notes and security-advisory preparation docs.
- [Lessons learned](./slo/lessons/) — per-milestone notes capturing design decisions and surprises.
- [Launch artifacts](./launch/) — outreach drafts, blog pitches, CFP submissions.
- Runbooks — [AWS](./slo/completed/RUNBOOK-hulumi.md), [GitHub](./slo/completed/RUNBOOK-hulumi-github.md), [K8s baseline](./slo/completed/RUNBOOK-hulumi-k8s.md), [combined Operations + K8s security](./slo/completed/RUNBOOK-hulumi-operations-k8s-security.md). Layout convention: [docs/slo/README.md](./slo/README.md).

## Papers

Two formats of the same material on the drift classifier. Pick whichever fits how you want to read it.

- [Drift detection that actually tells you what happened](./papers/drift-detection-narrative.md) — narrative tour. Reads start-to-finish; uses analogies; explains the verdict matrix, the TLA+ verification, the probe, and the guardrails by building intuition first. Good as a blog draft, a handout, or a reading list entry.
- [TLA+-Verified Drift Detection for Pulumi](./papers/drift-detection.md) — reference paper. Same content in dense citation form with code-line links, file paths, and a §-by-§ index. Good when you want to point at a specific test or trace a property to its source.

## Conventions used in these docs

- **IDs only.** Every reference to CCM, AICM, CIS, CAIQ, NIST, or ATLAS controls is by ID with a link to the upstream. We never embed verbatim control text in `skills/` or `packages/` source. See [licensing.md](./mappings/licensing.md) for the rationale.
- **Code samples are the contract.** TypeScript snippets in component docs and cookbooks are kept in sync with `packages/*/tests/` BDD suites. If a snippet here drifts from the test, the test wins — please open an issue.
- **Release notes are the contract.** The root [README release history](../README.md#release-history) and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) tell you which package release shipped each public API. If a doc references something marked `planned`, treat it as a forward reference, not a present-tense API.
